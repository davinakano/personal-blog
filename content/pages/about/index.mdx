Hi!

My name is Davi - not _David_ - Nakano. Front End Developer currently working at [IC](https://icthrive.com/) in North Vancouver - Canada.

During my career, I have worked with multiple stacks and domains. Ranging from C# / WPF for Windows Desktop applications, going briefly to iOS development with Swift and React Native, and finally **Front End with React** (which is my current expertise).

Originally from Brazil and eager to discover the world, I have also lived and worked as a developer in the UK and Japan.

Being versatile and always ready to face new challenges are some qualities often pointed to me.

Feel free to say hi!
