Ok, here we go. I have lost count on how many times I have tried to maintain a blog but I believe this (could ?) be it.

One of the big reasons that made me create this blog was the [tech stack](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) behind it and this [clean theme](https://github.com/LekoArts/gatsby-themes/tree/master/themes/gatsby-theme-minimal-blog).

Since this is the very first post, I won't be taking too much of your time. Let's roll!
